Definitions:

Convolution - An operation that extracts relevant constituent features from channels which helps a image processing problem.
Filters/Kernels - A mask that extracts relevant features for a particular image processing problem.
Epochs - A complete cycle of data through a network
1x1 Convolution - Kernel which help reducing the number of channels
3x3 Convolution - Kernel that helps in extracting feature and reducing feature map by a dimension of 2x2
Feature Maps - The resultant channels which contains similar extracted feature from previous channels
Activation Function - The function which brings in non linearity in a neural network thus enabling them to assume any possible function
Receptive Field - The point which has extracted sufficient information about previous layer to enable a network solve a loss function
